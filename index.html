          <h2 class="whats__title">What is Local SEO?</h2>
          <div class="whats__body">
            <p class="whats__body_text">
              Local SEO refers to optimizing a website and online content to
              rank better for geographic and location-based searches in search
              engine results pages (SERPs). The goal is to appear prominently
              when potential customers search for local products, services, or
              businesses on Google, Bing, and other search engines. For
              instance, when someone searches for "Italian restaurants near me,"
              local SEO helps drive web traffic by getting your business to show
              up in the map pack result and/or top organic search results for
              that local query. Unlike regular SEO which focuses on ranking well
              for broad keywords, local SEO is all about optimizing for
              hyperlocal searches like: [location] + [business type or service]
              [business type or service] + near me [business name] + [location]
              So if you run an Italian restaurant in San Diego, your local SEO
              would revolve around ranking for searches like “Italian
              restaurants San Diego”, “Italian restaurants near me”, and
              “Luigi’s San Diego” (if Luigi’s was your restaurant name).
