      Really any business with a physical location - including single-location
      Mom & Pop shops to multi-location franchises - can benefit immensely from
      local search engine optimization. By claiming and optimizing your local
      business listings and executing other location-based SEO best practices,
      you make it easier for nearby searchers to discover and patronize your
      business.
